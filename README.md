## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

-   [Node (>= v20.18.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
-   Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)

## Customizing the token

Edit your smart contract located in `packages/hardhat/contracts/YourToken.sol`

Optionally modify the constructor with your own token name and symbol.

```
    constructor(address _owner) ERC20("YourToken", "YT") Ownable(_owner) {
        _mint(_owner, 21000000000000000000000000);
    }
```

Optionally, modify the deploy script to take ownership of the contract.

```
  const owner = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"; // add your address here

  await deploy("YourToken", {
    from: deployer,
    // Contract constructor arguments
    args: [owner], // use the owner variable to set who owns the contract during deployment
    log: true,
    // autoMine: can be passed to the deploy function to make the deployment process faster on local networks by
    // automatically mining the contract deployment transaction. There is no effect on live networks.
    autoMine: true,
  });
```

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/mega-eth-subgraph-workshop.git
cd mega-eth-subgraph-workshop
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```bash
yarn chain
```

4. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

5. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```bash
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`

## üöÄ Setup The Graph Integration

Now that we have spun up our blockchain, started our frontend application and deployed our smart contract, we can start setting up our subgraph and utilize The Graph!

> Before following these steps be sure Docker is running!

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Clean up any old data and spin up our docker containers ‚úÖ

First run the following to clean up any old data. Do this if you need to reset everything.

```
yarn subgraph:clean-node
```

> We can now spin up a graph node by running the following command‚Ä¶ üßë‚ÄçüöÄ

```
yarn subgraph:run-node
```

This will spin up all the containers for The Graph using docker-compose. You will want to keep this window open at all times so that you can see log output from Docker.

> As stated before, be sure to keep this window open so that you can see any log output from Docker. üîé

> NOTE FOR LINUX USERS: If you are running Linux you will need some additional changes to the project.

##### Linux Only

**For hardhat**

Update your package.json in packages/hardhat with the following command line option for the hardhat chain.

```
"chain": "hardhat node --network hardhat --no-deploy --hostname 0.0.0.0"
```

You might also need to add a firewall exception for port 8432. As an example for Ubuntu... run the following command.

```
sudo ufw allow 8545/tcp
```

#### ‚úÖ Step 2: Create and ship our subgraph ‚úÖ

Now we can open up a fifth window to finish setting up The Graph. üòÖ In this fifth window we will create our local subgraph!

> Note: You will only need to do this once.

```
yarn subgraph:create-local
```

> You should see some output stating your subgraph has been created along with a log output on your graph-node inside docker.

Next we will ship our subgraph! You will need to give your subgraph a version after executing this command. (e.g. 0.0.1).

```
yarn subgraph:local-ship
```

> This command does the following all in one‚Ä¶ üöÄüöÄüöÄ

-   Copies the contracts ABI from the hardhat/deployments folder
-   Generates the networks.json file
-   Generates AssemblyScript types from the subgraph schema and the contract ABIs.
-   Compiles and checks the mapping functions.
-   ‚Ä¶ and deploy a local subgraph!

> If you get an error ts-node you can install it with the following command

```
npm install -g ts-node
```

You should get a build completed output along with the address of your Subgraph endpoint.

```
Deployed to http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/scaffold-eth/your-contract/graphql

Subgraph endpoints:
Queries (HTTP):     http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/scaffold-eth/your-contract
```

#### ‚úÖ Step 3: Test your Subgraph ‚úÖ

Go ahead and head over to your subgraph endpoint and take a look!

> Here is an example query‚Ä¶

```
query MyQuery {
  transfers(first: 10, orderBy: id, orderDirection: asc) {
    blockNumber
    blockTimestamp
    from
    id
    to
    transactionHash
    value
  }
}
```

> If all is well and you've sent a transaction to your smart contract then you will see a similar data output!

```
{
  "data": {
    "transfers": [
      {
        "blockNumber": "3",
        "blockTimestamp": "1743789408",
        "from": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "id": "0x0c15fcaf5e6948686c0c98d9066a1539bf0642db25e06460a3eafb7c08dfca6501000000",
        "to": "0xf39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266",
        "transactionHash": "0x0c15fcaf5e6948686c0c98d9066a1539bf0642db25e06460a3eafb7c08dfca65",
        "value": "21000000000000000000000000"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Deploying to MEGA ETH Testnet

1. Generate a deployer key

```
yarn generate
```

2. Fund the deployer

A MEGA ETH faucet can be found on the [MEGA ETH Testnet Website](https://testnet.megaeth.com/)

If you need to add the chain to Metamask, you can do so by going [here](https://www.megaexplorer.xyz/) and clicking the Metamask MegaETH Testnet icon on the bottom right of the explorer.

```
yarn account
```

3. Deploy to MEGA ETH Testnet

```
yarn deploy --network megaTestnet
```

[Here](https://www.megaexplorer.xyz/address/0x9C61D2Ac8e57554cB09c1dbF7B591a520dD54d5C) is an example deployment of the contract which comes with this repo.

> A note about contract verification, currently this is not very easy to do on MEGA ETH Testnet so we don't recommend it. We will update this workshop once the steps are more easily defined.

## Shipping to Subgraph Studio üöÄ

> NOTE: This step requires [deployment of contract](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/deploying/deploy-smart-contracts) to live network. Checkout list of [supported networks](https://thegraph.com/docs/networks).

1. Update the `packages/subgraph/subgraph.yaml` file with your contract address, network name, start block number(optional) :

    ```diff
    ...
    -     network: localhost
    +     network: megaeth-testnet
          source:
            abi: YourToken
    +       address: "0x9C61D2Ac8e57554cB09c1dbF7B591a520dD54d5C"
    +       startBlock: 0
    ...
    ```

    TIP: For `startBlock` you can use block number of your deployed contract, which can be found by visiting deployed transaction hash in block explorer.

2. Create a new subgraph on [Subgraph Studio](https://thegraph.com/studio) and get "SUBGRAPH SLUG" and "DEPLOY KEY".

3. Authenticate with the graph CLI:

    ```sh
    yarn graph auth <DEPLOY KEY>
    ```

4. Codegen and build

    ```sh
    yarn graph codegen
    ```

    ```sh
    yarn graph build
    ```

5. Deploy the subgraph to TheGraph Studio:

    ```sh
    yarn graph deploy <SUBGRAPH SLUG>
    ```

    Once deployed, the CLI should output the Subgraph endpoints. Copy the HTTP endpoint and test your queries.

6. Update `packages/nextjs/components/ScaffoldEthAppWithProviders.tsx` to use the above HTTP subgraph endpoint:
    ```diff
    - const subgraphUri = "http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/scaffold-eth/your-contract";
    + const subgraphUri = 'YOUR_SUBGRAPH_ENDPOINT';
    ```
